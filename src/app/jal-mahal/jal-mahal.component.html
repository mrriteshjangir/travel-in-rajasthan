            <h3>The History of Jal Mahal</h3>

            <p>Built by Maharaj Madho Singh in 1750, it was never meant to be a grand palace, all the Maharaja wanted was a simple lodge for himself when he went duck hunting.  During the 18th century Madho’s son, Madho Singh II decided to enhance the beauty of the building by adding courtyard grounds and making changes to the exteriors.</p>

            <h3>The Architecture </h3>
            <p>This palace is a great example of the Rajput style of architecture and owing to its location, it is also a great place for phenomenal views. You get a great view of the lake from the palace; you get a great view of the palace from the Nahargarh (“tiger-abode”) hills and the Man Sagar Dam.</p>
